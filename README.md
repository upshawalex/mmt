MMT (Multipurpose Media Tool) is intended to (eventually) be a piece of software that automates systematic collection and organization of files. It will ideally be flexible enough to use for a range of applications from reorganizing local files to collecting  and sorting media from the web based on certain criteria. I anticipate adding details on how I intend this software to work and how I think it might be useful once I am further along and have made more design decisions.

I intend to implement this particular project in Java to ensure portability, because Java generally facilitates writing robust object-oriented software, and because I do not feel Java's limitations will be obstacles to this particular project.

I intend for this project to be free software under the GNU GPL v3.0.

Currently, this project is an unfinished project. In fact, I would go so far to describe it as an unstarted project at the moment, although I do hope to change that one of these days.
